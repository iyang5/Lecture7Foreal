# N741: Lecture 7 - More on Data (and Code) Wrangling

Today's lecture will focus more on "data wrangling"" - specifically working with the functions in the `dplyr` package. We will also review and go more in depth on how a Rmarkdown (RMD) file works when compiled ("knitted"). We will also review good practices for coding and keeping your syntax so that it is easier for you and others to read (aka "code wrangling").
